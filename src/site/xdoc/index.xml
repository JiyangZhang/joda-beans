<section name="Joda Beans">
<p>
Joda-Beans provides a small framework that greatly enhances working with JavaBeans.
The key concept is to allow each property on a bean to be accessed as an object.
This enables technologies such as XPath, XML conversion, DB mappings, WebApp validation and Swing bindings.

<!--

As a flavour of Joda-Beans, here's some example code:

The JDK classes Date and Calendar are very badly designed, have had numerous bugs
and have odd performance effects.
Here are some of our reasons for developing and using Joda-Time:

<section name="Releases">
<p>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=97367&amp;package_id=104212">Release 1.4</a>
is the current latest release.
This release is considered stable and worthy of the 1.x tag.
It has extensive testing suites and has been used in production.
We now recommend JDK 1.3 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.
</p>
<p>
We will support the 1.x product line using standard Java mechanisms.
The main public API will remain backwards compatible for both source and binary.
The version number will change to 2.0 to indicate a change in compatibility.
