 * Code generator for Joda-Beans.
 * <p>
 * The main code generator class is {@code BeanCodeGen}, which is a command line tool.
 * <p>
 * Use of the code generator is optional with Joda-Beans, but it is the most common approach.
 * The code generator is <i>regenerative</i>. It may be run again and again on the same
 * file without damaging any changes made in the "user" part of the file.
 * Only the "code-generated" part of the file will be altered by the generator.
